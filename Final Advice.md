Congratulations on finishing our Solidity Bootcamp. In this bootcamp, we have developed a smart contract and learned some important concepts.


We learned how to use Remix IDE to develop, deploy and test smart contracts.


Also in Solidity, we learned some important concepts that are essential for any Solidity developer. Some of these are: structs, mappings, modifiers, constructor, and functions.


These topics will work as our foundational knowledge on Solidity and what we learn more will come on top of these topics. So, we can say that you already finished the hard part ðŸ˜Š


Although these topics create a good basis for our Solidity knowledge, Solidity offers much more to discover. Now let's look at the next steps you can take to become an experienced web3 developer.


PRACTICE


First, it is always important to practice. We recommend you experiment with some smart contracts. You can try topics like crowdfunding, marketplace, auction, and any other contract that you like. At this stage, I also recommend learning about non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and fungible tokens. You can check out ERC721 (NFT) and ERC20 standards which are smart contracts for NFT and fungible token standards.


FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT


This step is not mandatory for everyone. But if you have a front-end background, then it would not be too hard. Also knowing how to call your smart contract from the frontend can help you build your own decentralized application. For that reason, whether you have prior front-end experience or not, I believe you can benefit from learning front-end development for web3 projects.


For the front-end development we have two popular libraries: Web3.js and Ethers.js. They are both easy to learn if you have a front-end development background.

LOCAL DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT AND TESTING


In this tutorial, we have used Remix IDE which is great for starting smart contract development. But as you start testing your contract, you will see that working with a local development environment can be easier sometimes.


In the previous steps, we have worked on our smart contract development and frontend skills. Even though these skills are important, it is even more crucial to be able to test contracts once we want to release them to the test-net, or even the main-net! Since the smart contract code is not updatable, it becomes even more important for developers to test their contracts. For that reason, you may want to learn frameworks such as Truffle and Hardhat.


LOOKING FOR JOBS


First, it is important that we have a portfolio, where people can see our previous projects that we have worked on. We use our portfolio during job applications and interviews. Also, being active on platforms like X(Twitter) and LinkedIn are also helpful.


With the portfolio demonstrating our understanding and experience in the field, we can comfortably apply for; smart contract developer, tester, full stack web3 developer, and many more positions. 


Once again, at this stage it is important that you have projects in your portfolio that you can show. You can use GitHub to store your projects.


If you do not want to look for a job, you can also produce your own project which can be easy and cheap too. You can implement your idea with a smart contract. You will also get paid through this contract. For the user interaction, you will need a front end and that is it. Your fully functional business is ready ðŸ˜Š 


There are a lot of possibilities with web3, so we believe that the more experience you have on the field, the clearer it will get what you want to do in the field.


Even though we still have a couple of steps in front of us, you have passed the hardest one which is the first step. I want to personally thank you and congratulate you on your new journey.
